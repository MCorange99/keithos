  ## Installation
  
  You can add Keithos to your server with [this](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=837371090783174696&permissions=4294967287&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.events.stdlib.com%2Fdiscord%2Fauth%2F&scope=bot%20applications.commands) link!.
  
  
  ### Colors
  
  Upon being invited to a server, Keithos will automatically create **6** predefined colors for your server to enjoy. To add more, use the provided `createcolor` command to quickly and easily create new colors.
  
  To add colors manually, first create a few empty roles at the bottom of your server's role hierarchy. The names of these roles must begin with the character `#`, for example, `#Red` or `#Blue`. Then change the color of that role to your desired hex, and that's it! After they are set up, the members of your server can then change their color by using Keithos color commands!
